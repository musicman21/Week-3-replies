	shorttitle = {Academia After Virtue?},
	abstract = {An extensive literature has focused on the impact of new public management ({NPM}) oriented structural changes on academics’ practice and identity. These critical studies have been resolute in concluding that {NPM} inevitably leads to a degeneration of academics’ ethos and values. Drawing from the moral philosophy of Alasdair {MacIntyre}, we argue that these previous analyses have overlooked the moral agency of the academics and their role in ‘moralizing’ and consequently shaping the ethical nature of their practices. The paper provides a new theoretical understanding of {NPM}-oriented reforms in light of the virtue ethics approach, thereby directing the attention to the moral character and moral agency of academics. Our analysis of interviews collected in the business department of a Danish university provides an example of how individuals have divergent ethical understandings of these structural changes and enact/resist pre-defined social roles in different ways. While in some cases the {NPM} agenda of the institutions has triggered internal moral conflict and a crisis of moral character, in other cases the new logic resonates with academics’ values and evaluative standards. Partially departing from the theoretical ground of {MacIntyre} (1981), we conclude that academics can play a crucial role in shaping the morality of {NPM}-oriented institutions and in transforming these settings into suitable contexts for the cultivation of virtues.},

	abstract = {Ethical leadership is the best response in the crisis state of postmodern man. Ethical leadership is a construct that leads to personal transfiguration, organizational effectiveness, improved interpersonal communication, and the achievement of a joint platform for professional action. Its development has also a beneficial effect as it brings ethics back to the core of public action, to the front line of organizational life and personal development. Whether it follows a religious model or a model resulting from laicized religious values, leadership construing is based on a personal development process that follows an initiating structure in the world of values and their practice in personal ethical action. This is doubled by an ethics institutionalization process in which the organization itself becomes a structure of ethical and effective communication both inside and outside. An authentic leadership supposes positing the leader in the center of an ethical edifice in which achieving public good is done through instruments of personal development, ethics management and managerial ethics, ethical responsibility and sustainability, human condition improvement, spiritual transfiguration and authenticity. Added to this is the leader's personal effort of involvement in the organization. Ethical leadership relies on a person's vocation of developing an ethical culture in professional situations and in all life experiences.},

	abstract = {This article refers to selected issues elaborated from my interdisciplinary doctoral thesis accomplished at the University of South Africa in 2019. I investigated the ethical-theoretical frameworks as well as practices of Christian humanitarian non-governmental organisations ({NGOs}) in Germany by combining a theoretical part (including philosophy, theology, business studies and development studies) and an empirical part. The empirical part was accomplished by interviewing 11 {NGOs} from the humanitarian field (development and/or relief agencies in an international context). The findings of theory and practice showed that many Christian {NGOs} typically conform to the secular mindset and regulations in order to be able to function as organisations. The results also revealed that Christian {NGOs} have difficulties in defining their identity in order to be attractive and convincing to their current and prospective employees and donors. In addition, organisational and hierarchical structures are mostly taken from business companies but do not necessarily always fit to the individual organisations. The research is significant because it shows to what extent these {NGOs} experience tensions and insecurities having to work in a secular environment, and it helps to identify some typical challenges that Christian organisations face in Western countries. The purpose of the thesis was to impact on the reflection and practice of leaders of {NGOs} in their quest to understand developments and paradigm shifts, and ensure that they will act in a recognisably Christian way.Contribution: This article has been held as a presentation at the Leadership Conference in Pretoria, South Africa, in 2019. It contributes to the research of specific Christian leadership, and particularly of leadership in Christian non-governmental organisations. This article aims to describe the challenges these organisations face, having to work in the midst of a secular environment.},

	abstract = {In considering what it means to lead organizations effectively and ethically, the literature comprising spirituality at work ({SAW}) and spiritual leadership theory ({SLT}) has become highly influential, especially in the {USA}. It has also attracted significant criticism. While in this paper, we endorse this critique, we argue that the strand of literature which purportedly takes a Christian standpoint within the wider {SAW} school of thought, largely misconstrues and misapplies the teaching of its founder, Jesus. As a result, in dismissing the claims and application of {SAW} and {SLT}, there is a real risk that we lose the vital contribution of Christian thought, not least some of the timeless counter-cultural wisdom of Jesus which, we contend, offers a vital foundation to the practice of ethical leadership and business ethics in organizations. In proposing a way forward, two thorny issues which face all leaders are addressed: dealing with ego and closing the gap between what we say and what we do. The more we understand about the dynamics of human nature, the more we learn about the profundity of Jesus’ teachings. We then propose a number of ways in which Jesus-centred ethical leadership can be practised. Each is radical and each implies risk: both the personal risk of inner renewal arising from repentance as a doorway to personal integrity, as well as the risk of opposing unethical practices and promoting the excellence of core practices in the workplace.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to investigate the level at which the charismatic leadership style of school principals perceived by teachers predicts the school culture. Research Method: The correlational model, a quantitative research model, was conducted. In this study, 490 teachers participated in Uskudar, Istanbul. The School Culture Scale (Terzi, 2005) and the Charismatic Leadership Scale (Conger \& Kanungo, 1994) were used to measure the teacher's perception of the charismatic leadership and school culture. Correlation analysis was performed to identify the relationship between the charismatic leadership style and the school culture perceived by the teachers. Regression analysis was performed to determine whether the charismatic leadership style was a predictor of school culture. Findings: The findings obtained after the analyses showed that there was a significant positive relationship between the charismatic leadership and the success culture, support culture, mission culture, and bureaucratic culture and that the charismatic leadership style was a predictor of, respectively, the success culture, support culture, mission culture, and bureaucratic culture. The charismatic leadership explains 29\% of the total variance in mission culture, 35\% of the total variance in support culture, 36\% of the total variance in success culture and 5\% of the total variance in bureaucratic culture. Implications for Research and Practice: The charismatic leadership role of school principals in shaping the school culture should be emphasized. It may be suggested that charismatic leaders who manage the school culture effectively can be successful. (English)},

The authors review the emerging literature on these new styles - ideological leadership, pragmatic leadership, authentic leadership, ethical leadership, spiritual leadership, distributed leadership, and integrative public leadership - as well as the recent work on servant leadership. They also comment on the Ohio State studies on leadership, and then discuss the ways in which these many styles overlap with transformational leadership and each other, and issue a call to leadership researchers to collectively develop a new 'full-range' model of leadership that encompasses and distills what is unique about these various styles. The authors argue that such an integrated full-range model is necessary for research on leadership style to progress.},

Drawing on the attraction–selection–attrition model of organizational behavior, we propose a selective attrition effect whereby unethical leader behavior results in the retention of group members who are more comfortable with dishonesty and, consequently, more likely to engage in unethical behavior toward their group. In two experiments, exposure to unethical leader behavior (vs. ethical leader behavior) increased group members’ likelihood of choosing to leave the group. Members who chose to remain in a group with an unethical leader were more likely than those who chose to leave to cheat their group in a subsequent task. A two time-period survey replicated these findings and identified psychological distress as the mechanism driving group members’ turnover intentions. This research extends our understanding of the complex relationships between unethical leadership and follower turnover intentions, psychological distress, and malfeasance. We contribute to the behavioral ethics literature by identifying a previously underappreciated form of selective attrition that produces internal costs to groups and organizations, independent of reputational consequences and whether the unethicality is publicized.},

This study proposes to test the relationship between corporate psychopathy traits and abusive supervision, employees' job satisfaction and intention to quit their job. A total of 97 employees from a non-profit organization completed measures of their abusive supervision and corporate psychopathy traits as well as self-report measures of job satisfaction and turnover intentions. Corporate psychopathy was positively and significantly correlated with abusive supervision and turnover intentions and negatively correlated with employees' job satisfaction. {SEM} results indicate that, although the B-Scan 360 has a direct influence on turnover intentions, it influences job satisfaction through abusive supervision behavior.

While negative traits could be an important factor explaining the relationship between a {CEO}’s immoral and unethical behavior and corporate social responsibility ({CSR}), there has been minimal research focusing on this relationship. This paper thus attempts to investigate how a {CEO} exhibiting these negative traits affects {CSR}, and if an employee’s perception of ethics and social responsibility would mediate the relationship. In addition, this paper considers the moderating effects of an individual performance-based compensation system ({IPBCS}) between employee’s {CSR} perception and {CSR} activities. The data are collected through a survey conducted on 165 employees (companies) in twelve industries. The regression result indicates an inverse relationship between the negative traits of a {CEO} and an employee’s perception of ethics and social responsibility and {CSR} activities, and the mediating effect of the perception in the relationship between the negative traits and {CSR} activities. It also indicates that an {IPBCS} moderates the relationship between {CSR} perception and activities. Implications for the study, future research directions, and management approach are discussed.},

	abstract = {There are many harmful leadership styles--the egotistic leader, the incompetent leader, the ignorant leader, and leaders that are reckless, cruel, or even evil. To understand what ultimately are considered leadership traits that are contrary to good order, discipline and productivity, the author conducted a review of the literature to obtain a current typology (the grouping of items by their similarities) of selected harmful leadership styles--specific styles that are counter to enabling others to succeed, overcome challenges, achieve desired results, and create a positive environment in which to work. The paper focused on three distinctly harmful leadership styles (abusive, bullying, and toxic), and set these in context with each other and within the domain of destructive leadership in general. Commonalities, measurements, negative impacts, and ways to improve these harmful leadership styles were identified from the literature and detailed. The paper concluded with recommendations for future research and action. [Note: The publication month (July) shown on the {PDF} is incorrect. The correct month of publication is June.]},

Two leadership styles (task oriented and authoritarian styles) were identified as possible mediators. Design/methodology/approach Narcissism was measured by using Narcissistic Personality Inventory (Ames et al., 2006), performance was measured by performance scale (Greene-Shortridge, 2008). Sinha's leadership scale (Sinha, 2008) was used to measure task-oriented and authoritarian leadership styles. 273 senior-level managers of a big public sector Indian organization participated in the study. {SPSS} 22 and {SmartPLS} 2.0 were used to analyze the data. Findings Correlation result shows that narcissism personality trait was positively related to authoritarian leadership style and negatively to task-oriented leadership style, task performance and teamwork dimensions of performance. Task-oriented leadership style mediated the relationship between narcissism and task performance and teamwork more than the authoritarian leadership style. Originality/value The study attempts to empirically test the behavioral manifestation of narcissism personality trait as positive or negative and has considered the whole measure of performance which has not been previously explored. Practical implications were also highlighted beside the theoretical concerns.},

This study extends research on multiplicative effects of normative leader characteristics to consider how narcissism becomes particularly disruptive when combined with other extreme interpersonal tendencies. Moderated multiple regression results show interactions involving selected trait pairs varied across samples. Pooled analyses showed (a) differential generalizability across trait pairings and (b) that lower tiered managerial roles and weaker industrial contexts may release such effects. Inconsistencies suggest the need to consider sample-specific trait demands in future trait interaction research, normal, or maladaptive. All told, findings suggest that subclinical personality interactions might accelerate leader derailment, offer unique insights into leader competence, and extend trait interaction research to aberrant tendencies.},

	abstract = {A common and important feature within models of career management is the career goal, yet relatively little is known about the factors influencing career goals and when and how career goal setting occurs. Drawing from Ashforth’s (2001) model of role transitions we propose and test a model wherein mentoring experiences of early career professionals relate to short- and long-term career goals through professional identification. Using survey data collected at three points in time from 312 early career professionals, we find that psychosocial mentoring, but not career mentoring, positively relates to professional identification. For short-term goal outcomes, professional identification positively relates to extrinsic goals, intrinsic goals, and goals that are high quality (i.e., specific, difficult, to which one is committed). For long-term goal outcomes, professional identification positively relates to extrinsic and intrinsic goals, but not to goal quality. Instead, in the long-term goal model, psychosocial mentoring is directly related to goal quality. The theoretical and practical implications of this study for professional identification, career goals, and how mentors can facilitate career goals are discussed.

These are issues like humility, love, self-issues, confidence, as well as issues of ontology and how to teach servant leadership. In this study, Scripture has nuanced, expanded, and even critiqued the contemporary model of servant leadership. It is here that the virtue model of servant leadership is expanded based upon the biblical perspective that has the wisdom of antiquity as well as divine insights. This model has three stages of preparation for leadership that is personal and ontological; it brings real change to the person. The first stage is foundational with several ingredients for development and even keys for the process itself. The second stage is the process of leadership, and it includes virtues like the contemporary theory of servant leadership. However, it adds other attributes of leadership related to authority, guidance, and gifting. Then there is a final stage or third stage at the end of the leadership term, but it impacts how one leads in the second stage. Together this forms a robust though complicated model for biblical servant leadership.},

	abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to examine how servant leadership and political skill combine to impact workplace spirituality and employee creativity.
Design/methodology/approach
Participants were working adults recruited by graduate and undergraduate students from a {US} public regional comprehensive university. Data were collected across three time periods, with a final sample size of 280 participants.
Findings
The authors' findings suggest that servant leaders impact employee creativity by fostering an environment that promotes workplace spirituality. Furthermore, this relationship is strengthened to the extent that the servant leader possesses high levels of political skill.
Research limitations/implications
This study provides a foundation for the interplay between servant leadership and political skill. Therefore, the data collection procedures undertaken in this study (i.e. from sources in multiple organizations) are beneficial. A limitation to this study is the use of a single informant to measure all of the constructs, which may cause a bias in the results.
Practical implications
This study provides a foundation for the interplay between servant leadership and political skill. Therefore, the data collection procedures undertaken in this study (i.e. from sources in multiple organizations) are beneficial.
Originality/value
Although servant leadership research continues to receive increased attention in the extant literature, researchers have tended to focus on the relational aspects of servant leadership. Curiously, the "leader" side of servant leadership has been largely neglected. As a result, some have questioned the construct as a viable leadership model. Greenleaf (1977), however, noted that servant leaders also possess conceptual skills; yet, these skills are rarely included in servant leadership measurements or empirical studies. The authors argue that political skill captures the essence of these abilities, and that including it strengthens the servant leader's impact on workplace spirituality, ultimately influencing employee creativity.},

	abstract = {Top management teams ({TMTs}) and boards of directors (boards) face increasingly turbulent environments as they strategically lead firms toward superior firm performance. The dominant theoretical lens about these two groups is agency theory, which focuses on the need for independence. We suggest that the environment in which the {TMT} and board govern is broader than conceptualized by agency theory, and thus theories regarding strategic leadership also require expansion. Drawing from the multiteam systems literature and broader systems theory, we offer a new consideration of the {TMT} and board as part of a strategic-oriented multiteam system, which we refer to as a strategic leadership system. The core premise of our theorizing is that {TMTs} and boards that strongly emphasize attention to both working independently and interdependently enhance their group and shared task performance, and in turn, firm performance. We further nuance this theorizing by describing how external environmental characteristics (i.e., munificence, complexity, dynamism) strengthen or weaken the influence of attention to working independently or interdependently, thereby shifting the zones of system effectiveness. Based on this theorizing, we offer a 2 × 2 framework combined with practical recommendations for strategic leaders. Additional implications, limitations, and directions for future research are discussed.},

	abstract = {This paper makes the case that a balanced view of strategic leadership can be developed by synthesizing strategic leadership theory ({SLT}) and the balanced scorecard theory ({BSCT}). According to this view, 1) {BSC} is reconceived as a set of choices made by strategic leaders. 2) Such choices are purposely planned and directed in four domains set by {BSCT} in a balanced fashion to give them more purpose and strategic momentum. 3) Strategies of the firm can be mapped from a behavioural view of {BSC}. We believe, not only this view helps advance strategic leadership theory in a more systematic way but it also offers new avenues to make use of balanced scorecard theory. This marriage also offers new insights into the behavioural side of strategy mapping and performance measurement previously done mechanistically by {BSCT} without considering the behavioural components of strategy as stressed in {SLT}.},

	abstract = {The objective of the present study was to determine whether teacher collaboration is a mediator of the strategic leadership and teaching quality in schools. This study involved 300 teachers in the high prestige secondary schools in Kelantan, Malaysia, whereby a cross-sectional survey approach using a standard questionnaire was used. The strategic leadership instrument used has been adapted from Hairuddin Ali (2012), while the collaborative instrument has been adapted from Barkema and Moran (2013). In addition, to measure the teaching quality among teachers, the researcher adapted the questionnaire that has been developed by Shahril Marzuki (2005). The findings from multiple regression analysis show that teacher collaboration is a mediator of strategic leadership and teaching quality (B=0.14, p{\textless}0.05). It was recommended among others that the school leaders should continue to strengthen collaborative practices among teachers as an effort to improve teaching quality in their respective schools which in turn will help to improve school excellence, especially across the current era of globalization.},
