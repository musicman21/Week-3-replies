\textcite{Ding2020} defines strengths as personal characteristics. These characteristics allow individuals the ability to attain excellent performance \parencite{Ding2020}. It's obvious that you are aware of your strengths. And I bet that you are also aware of your weaknesses and in my opinion, that makes you humble. A humble leader can acknowledge their weaknesses while still appreciating the strengths of their followers \parencite{Ding2020}.

Your desire for more God-given wisdom is very commendable. We are could use more that type of wisdom. When one thinks of Godly wisdom, we normally would think of Solomon. But I believe that Elisha was given just as much wisdom. God granted Elisha a level of wisdom that he used to not only to fix the poison stew but also to humiliate the Syrian raiders \parencite{Merida2015}. God grants all of us a measure of wisdom but it is possible to ignore it like King Ahab did \parencite{Merida2015}. Ahab would occasionally use his God-given wisdom such as when he would repent but then he would have moments when he would ignore wisdom and do things such as worship Baal \parencite{Merida2015}.

I believe that our main reason for choosing Liberty is the same. I want to gain more biblical scholarship and gain the wisdom and the knowledge to apply it in both my personal life as well as my professional life.
