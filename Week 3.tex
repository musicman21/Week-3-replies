Jeroboam is definitely a winner. One could almost call him dysfunctional. According to \textcite{simonet_dark-side_2018}, dysfunctional leadership can have effects on an organization that are far-reaching. In the secular world, the cost of one dysfunctional leader can range from \$500,000 to \$3 million, which suggests that dysfunctional leadership is costly.

Jeroboam is set up for success. "Through the prophet Ahijah, God informs Jeroboam that he will have a
kingdom. The prophet tears a cloak into 12 pieces, giving 10 pieces
to Jeroboam to illustrate that he will have 10 tribes, while two remain for Davidâ€™s descendants (Judah and the unmentioned tribe of Benjamin)" \parencite[p. 68]{Merida2015}. Jeroboam is also promised that everything will be blessed if he will simply walks in the of God, but as the story progresses, we know that doesn't happen \parencite{bible}.  

\setlength{\parindent}{0.5in}
According to \textcite{cialdini_how_2019}, if a leader possesses negative leaderships traits and can't trust their own people, then failure is inevitable. Unfortunately, as you state, Jeroboam doesn't repent and this eventually leads to disaster. He continues to sin, his son dies, and Jeroboam loses his kingdom. All he had to do was repent of his evil ways and turn back to God. God have promised Jeroboam greatness if he simply followed the ways of David \parencite{Merida2015}.
